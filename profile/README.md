# Welcome to TomTom-forks

The purpose of this organization is to provide a space for TomTom Engineering teams to work on forks of existing open source projects. Some will have long-term upstream contributions towards the open source community. Others may be dependencies, possibly no longer actively maintained upstream.

Visit our [showcase site](https://tomtom-international.github.io/) for a selection of hand-picked open source projects by TomTom.

If you are looking for API/SDK example code or the projects we maintain and release as open source, please check out the [TomTom-International](https://github.com/tomtom-international) organization. 

For further questions about this organization please write an e-mail to opensource@tomtom.com

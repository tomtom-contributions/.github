# Welcome to TomTom-Contributions

The purpose of this organization and the codebases hosted under it are to provide a space for TomTom Engineering teams to work on long-term upstream contributions towards the open source community. The organization also hosts codebases we depend on which might not be actively maintained upstream anymore but we cannot yet remove as a dependency.

If you are looking for API/SDK example code or some of the projects we maintain and release as open source, please check out the [TomTom-International](https://github.com/tomtom-international) organization.

For further questions about this organization please write an e-mail to opensource@tomtom.com
